   I am a True Worshipper of the Church of Joe who lives eats breathes and

   This show is sub-par.  The acting is wooden, the special effects are
   obviously poor quality.  In general, it seems like a very cheap Star Trek
   ripoff.

   You call this Sci-Fi?  That is such a load of crap!  This show is just a

   我把 Linux 裝了，也用過幾次。它看起來跟其他作業系統沒兩樣。

   我*幾乎*祇用 linux。我放棄當 Linux.God，但是很高興能把 DOS 換掉。我祇用
   DOS 來玩電腦遊戲.
  '+++': |-
   我的系統上祇裝 Linux。我訂閱 comp.os.linux.*，有時甚至還回答上面的問題。

   我是個 Linux 巫師。我早餐喫 C 程式碼，
   還留下足夠的胃口作核心碼除錯。我裝了太多修正檔，
   在十個版本之前就搞不清楚是哪些了。Linux 的新手當我是 net.god。
  '+++++': |-
   我是 Linus，膜拜我吧。
  '-': >-
   我根本不想用 Linux，坦白說，我一點都不覺得它怎樣，有其他更好的作業系統，像是
   Mac、DOS 或 Amiga-OS。要不然，像 FreeBSD 這種自由 Unix OS 也更好。

   要是沒有這項功能，我就自己寫軟體來做到。

   I read so many news groups that the next batch of news comes in before I
   finish reading the last batch, and I have to read for about 2 hours straight
   before I'm caught up on the morning's news.  Then there's the afternoon...

   I finally managed to get OS/2 installed but wasn't too terribly impressed.

   I use OS/2 for all my computing needs.  I use some DOS and Windows programs,
   but rune them under OS/2.  If the program won't run under OS/2, then
   obviously I don't need it.
  '+++': ! >-

   Perl 是個強力的程式工具。我不再寫 shell 命令稿，都改用 Perl 寫了。
  '+++': ! >-
   Perl 是個非常強力的程式工具。我不僅停止寫 shell 命令稿，也不再使用 awk 或
   sed 了。少於一千行的程式我都用 Perl 來寫。
  '++++': >-
   我不止寫 Perl，我用它來說話。Perl
   超越了一切其它的程式語言。我徹底認為所有程式都可以化簡成一行 Perl。我用 Perl
   達到 U+++ 的境界。
  '+++++': |-
   我是 Larry Wall，Tom Christiansen，或 Randal Schwartz.
  '-': |-
   Perl 難道有什麼超過 awk 和 sed 的功能嗎？
  '--': |-

  '--': ! >-
   I feel that the glory of the Internet is in the anarchic, trusting
   environment that so nurtures the exchange of information.  Encryption just
   bogs that down.
  '---': ! >-
   If you support encryption on the Internet, you must be a drug dealer or
   terrorist or something like that.

   else what to do, on either side of the political fence.  If you don't like
   it, turn the bloody channel.
  '++': ! >-
   I give to liberal causes.  I march for gay rights.  I'm a card carrying
   member of the ACLU.  Keep abortion safe and legal.

   going to try cracking /etc/passwd next week, just don't tell anyone.
  '+++': ! >-
   I don't need to crack /etc/passwd because I just modified su so that it

   Unix is a passing fad compared to the real power in the universe, my VMS
   system.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a VMS sysadmin.  I wield far more power than those UNIX admins, because
   UNIX can be found on any dweeb's desktop.  Power through obscurity is my
   motto.
  '-': |-
   Unix is much better than VMS for my computing needs.
  '--': ! >-
   I would rather smash my head repeatedly into a brick wall than suffer the

   surf the web using my Newton and a cellular modem.

   It's just another TV show.
  '+': ! >-
   It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things good on television
   any more.
  '++': ! >-
   It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the movies on tape
   and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've built a few of the model kits
   too.  But you'll never catch me at one of those conventions.  Those people
   are kooks.
  '+++': ! >-
   It's not just a TV show, it's a religion.  I know all about warp field
   dynamics and the principles behind the transporter.  I have memorized the
   TECH manual.  I speak Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no
   life.
  '-': ! >-
   Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is.
    Perhaps I'm missing something but I just think it is bad drama.
  '--': ! >-
   Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner isn't an actor, he's
   a poser!  And what's with this Jean-Luc Picard?  A Frenchman with a British
   accent?  Come on.  I'd only watch this show if my remote control broke. 
   Isn't Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space?  Has Sisko even breathed in
   the last two seasons?
  '---': ! >-
   Star Trek SUCKS!  It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you
   trekkies out there, GET A LIFE!  (William Shatner is a t---).

   Ok, so I use MS Windows, I don't have to like it.
  '+': ! >-
   I have installed my own custom sounds, wallpaper, and screen savers so my PC
   walks and talks like a fun house.  Oh yeah, I have a hundred TrueType(tm)
   fonts that I've installed but never used.  I never lose Minesweeper and
   Solitaire
  '++': ! >-
   I write MS Windows programs in C and think about using C++ someday.  I've
   written at least one DLL.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a MS Windows programming god.  I wrote a VxD driver to allow MS Windows
   and DOS to share the use of my waffle iron.  P.S.  Unix sux.
  '++++': ! >-
   I have Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows NT Advanced Server all
   running on my SMP RISC machine.  I haven't seen daylight in six months.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Bill Gates
  '-': ! >-
   I'm still trying to install MS Windows and have at least one peripheral that
   never works right
  '--': ! >-
   MS Windows is a joke operating system.  Hell, it's not even an operating
   system.  NT is Not Tough enough for me either.  95 is how may times it will
   crash an hour.
  '---': ! >-
   Windows has set back the computing industry by at least 10 years.  Bill
   Gates should be drawn, quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disembowelled, and
   then REALLY hurt.
