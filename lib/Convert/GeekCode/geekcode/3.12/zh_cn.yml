   This show is sub-par.  The acting is wooden, the special effects are

  '+++++': |-
   我是 Linus，膜拜我吧。

   我根本不想用 Linux，坦白说，我一点都不觉得它怎样，有其它更好的操作系统，像是
   Mac、DOS 或 Amiga-OS。要不然，像 FreeBSD 这种自由 Unix OS 也更好。

   but rune them under OS/2.  If the program won't run under OS/2, then
   obviously I don't need it.

   Perl 是个非常强力的程序工具。我不仅停止写 shell 命令稿，也不再使用 awk 或
   sed 了。少于一千行的程序我都用 Perl 来写。

   超越了一切其它的程序语言。我彻底认为所有程序都可以化简成一行 Perl。我用 Perl

   it, turn the bloody channel.

   I am a VMS sysadmin.  I wield far more power than those UNIX admins, because
   UNIX can be found on any dweeb's desktop.  Power through obscurity is my

  '-': |-
   Unix is much better than VMS for my computing needs.

   surf the web using my Newton and a cellular modem.

   It's just another TV show.
  '+': ! >-
   It's a damn fine TV show and is one of the only things good on television
   any more.
  '++': ! >-
   It's the best show around.  I have all the episodes and the movies on tape
   and can quote entire scenes verbatim.  I've built a few of the model kits
   too.  But you'll never catch me at one of those conventions.  Those people
   are kooks.
  '+++': ! >-
   It's not just a TV show, it's a religion.  I know all about warp field
   dynamics and the principles behind the transporter.  I have memorized the
   TECH manual.  I speak Klingon.  I go to cons with Vulcan ears on.  I have no
   life.

   Maybe it is just me, but I have no idea what the big deal with Star Trek is.
    Perhaps I'm missing something but I just think it is bad drama.
  '--': ! >-
   Star Trek is just another Space Opera.  William Shatner isn't an actor, he's
   a poser!  And what's with this Jean-Luc Picard?  A Frenchman with a British
   accent?  Come on.  I'd only watch this show if my remote control broke. 
   Isn't Voyager just a rehash of Lost in Space?  Has Sisko even breathed in
   the last two seasons?
  '---': ! >-
   Star Trek SUCKS!  It is the worst crap I have ever seen! Hey, all you
   trekkies out there, GET A LIFE!  (William Shatner is a t---).

   Ok, so I use MS Windows, I don't have to like it.
  '+': ! >-
   I have installed my own custom sounds, wallpaper, and screen savers so my PC
   walks and talks like a fun house.  Oh yeah, I have a hundred TrueType(tm)
   fonts that I've installed but never used.  I never lose Minesweeper and
   Solitaire
  '++': ! >-
   I write MS Windows programs in C and think about using C++ someday.  I've
   written at least one DLL.
  '+++': ! >-
   I am a MS Windows programming god.  I wrote a VxD driver to allow MS Windows
   and DOS to share the use of my waffle iron.  P.S.  Unix sux.
  '++++': ! >-
   I have Windows, Windows 95, Windows NT, and Windows NT Advanced Server all
   running on my SMP RISC machine.  I haven't seen daylight in six months.
  '+++++': |-
   I am Bill Gates
  '-': ! >-
   I'm still trying to install MS Windows and have at least one peripheral that
   never works right
  '--': ! >-
   MS Windows is a joke operating system.  Hell, it's not even an operating
   system.  NT is Not Tough enough for me either.  95 is how may times it will
   crash an hour.
  '---': ! >-
   Windows has set back the computing industry by at least 10 years.  Bill
   Gates should be drawn, quartered, hung, shot, poisoned, disembowelled, and
   then REALLY hurt.
