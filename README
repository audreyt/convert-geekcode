NAME
    Convert::GeekCode - Convert and generate geek code sequences

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.61 of Convert::Geekcode, released
    November 7, 2010.

SYNOPSIS
        use Convert::GeekCode; # exports geek_decode()

        my @out = geek_decode(q(
        -----BEGIN GEEK CODE BLOCK-----

        my ($key, $val);
        print "[$key]\n$val\n\n" while (($key, $val) = splice(@out, 0, 2));

DESCRIPTION
    Convert::GeekCode converts and generates Geek Code sequences (cf.
    <http://geekcode.com/>). It supports different langugage codes and
    user-customizable codesets.

    Since version 0.5, this module uses YAML to represent the geek code
    tables, for greater readability and ease of deserialization. Please
    refer to <http://www.yaml.org/> for more related information.

    The geekgen and geekdec utilities are installed by default, and may be
    used to generate / decode geek code blocks, respectively.
